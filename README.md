# mi_utils

Since most of you fuckers don't read, let me make this as simple as simple can be.

*I offer this repo to the world as a **courtesy**. I forked it before the original author dropped off the planet and the repo went 404 and was lost. I'm neither a developer nor a programmer. I do not offer support for this repo.*

Don't contact me on GitHub, Discord, or via any other medium for support for MIAgimir's resources. You may [reach them here](https://github.com/Mesa-Indigo).

### üëãüèª Hi! Dave here,

When Agimir went on his hiatus, at first I panicked. I really enjoy his **mi_utils** resource. 

I've seen this sort of thing many times before, over the years. For whatever reason, developers leave active projects to die on Github in public archives. Sometimes it's real life creeping in, sometimes it's burnout. Sometimes, the repositories then disappear entirely. 

So, I did the smart thing and forked his repositories in September 2023. Sure as shit, they all went tits up and 404 in early 2024.

I have several of Agimir's repos on my profile on Github. I salvaged what I could, and they are forked here. I'm still looking for others that were removed before I could fork them. As I find them, I'll upload them.

I have looked at other forks. Many from those shady Github accounts that just fork everything that gets released to boost their traffic.

My fork is many commits ahead of them all. I estimate that this fork is likely the one of the latest updated by Agimir himself.

I am only learning to code in Lua. I can't do much with this right now, but I invite you to fork this and see what we can do yo improve upon what Agimir started. 

Since I am a potato ü•î I am unable to support this resource.
